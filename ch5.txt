Process = execution of an application (heavy). Processes don't share the same address space
Thread = path of execution (within a process). Threads share the same address space --> carefulwith concurrency and memory blocks.
Usually, 1 process is started with one thread.
Dispatcher ==> allow one process to acces the CPU.
Processes execute concurrently (share the hardware ressource CPU)


join_smp:
  mrc p15, 0, r0, c1, c0, 1 // read ACTLR
  orr r0, r0, #0x040 // set bit 6 (SMP) to 1
  mcr p15, 0, r0, c1, c0, 1 // write ACTLR
  bx lr

disjoin_smp:
  mrc p15, 0, r0, c1, c0, 1 // read ACTLR
  bic r0, #0x040 // clear bit 6 (SMP) to 1
  mcr p15, 0, r0, c1, c0, 1 // write ACTLR
  bx lr
