Process = execution of an application (heavy). Processes don't share the same address space
Thread = path of execution (within a process). Threads share the same address space --> carefulwith concurrency and memory blocks.
Usually, 1 process is started with one thread.
Dispatcher ==> allow one process to acces the CPU.
Processes execute concurrently (share the hardware ressource CPU)
